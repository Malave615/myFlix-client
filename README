Objective:
Using React, build the client-side for an app called myFlix based on its
existing server-side code (REST API and database).

The project consists of a list of movies along with a picture. The information displayed for each movie includes it's title, description, director and genre. The app also allows users to register an account in order to create a favMovies category.

The client-side of the myFlix app will include several interface views (built using the React library) that will
handle data through the (previously defined) REST API endpoints. This will complete the web app (both server-side and client-side) built using the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).

The projects dependencies are: Express, React, MongoDB, jsonWebToken, Mongoose, body-parser and passport.
